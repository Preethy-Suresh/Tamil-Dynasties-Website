                        <h1>Tamil Dynasties</h1>
                        <p>Tamil dynasties (தமிழ் பேரரசுகள்) are the kingdoms who ruled over present day Tamil Nadu, Sri
                            Lanka,
                            Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Odisha. These include the Pallavas, the Pandyas, the
                            Cholas
                            and the Cheras. South India, during the Sangam Age, was ruled by three dynasties-the Cheras,
                            Cholas and
                            Pandyas. The Chera country was geographically well placed to profit from maritime trade via
                            the extensive Indian Ocean networks. The Cholas were known for their naval power and trade
                            with Southeast Asia. The
                            Pandyas were known for their contribution to literature, art, and architecture. The Pallavas
                            were known for their patronage of the arts, literature, and architecture. The main source of
                            information about these kingdoms is traced from the literary
                            references of Sangam Period. The Sangam Age refers to a period of Tamil literature that
                            existed between 300 BCE and 300 CE. The term "Sangam" refers to a gathering of Tamil poets
                            and scholars who produced some of the finest works of Tamil literature.</p>
                        <div class="contentless">
                            <p>The medieval period of the history of Tamil Nadu saw the rise and fall of many kingdoms,
                                some of
                                whom went on to the extent of empires, exerting influences both in India and overseas.
                                The Cholas who
                                were very active during the Sangam age were entirely absent during the first few
                                centuries. The
                                period started with the rivalry between the Pandyas and the Pallavas, which in turn
                                caused the
                                revival of the Cholas. The Cholas went on to become a great power. Their decline saw the
                                brief
                                resurgence of the Pandyas. This period was also that of the re-invigorated Hinduism
                                during which
                                temple building and religious literature were at their best.</p>
                            <p>The Tamil people are a linguistic group with roots in modern south India and Sri Lanka,
                                although
                                many
                                have emigrated out of this region. The traditional homeland of the Tamil people is

                                        covering the southernmost region of the Indian subcontinent.</span></span>

                                written evidence suggests there were strong trade and economic links between Tamilakam

                                Mediterranean powers like Rome. Tamilakam is an important historical region for early

                                Shiva worship was particularly prominent during the period of the Three Crowned Kings.</p>

                            <h1>The Pallava Dynasty</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>The Pallava dynasty was a line of rulers who lived in southern India from the 4th to the 9th
                            century CE. While their exact origin has been open to debate, one major theory holds that
                            the
                            Pallavas emerged from the Satavahana dynasty, to which they had played a subordinate role.
                            Beyond that, it is theorized that the Pallava dynasty is descended from the Aryan people,
                            which
                            were a prehistoric group that lived in modern-day Iran. The Pallava dynasty ruled over
                            Kanchipuram, also called Kanci, which is located in the modern Tamil Nadu state in India.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Pallava dynasty is well-known for its architecture,
                            especially its Hindu temples. Some of
                            these temples exist today as early examples of medieval southern Indian temple architecture.
                            Many such examples are found in Mamallapuram, which is now a
                            historic town with many
                            monuments
                            and other pieces of important architecture. At the time of the Pallava dynasty, it was an
                            important port town. The Kailasanathar Temple in Kanchipuram, the Shore Temple, and the
                            Pancha Rathas of Mahabalipuram are some of the finest specimens of Pallava art and
                            architecture. The best sculptor of this period was Akshara. The period’s religious
                            resurgence sparked an interest in architecture.
                            The Pallavas made significant contributions to Indian architecture and art. In actuality,
                            the Pallavas founded the Dravidian architectural style of southern India. There was a
                            progressive evolution from cave temples to monolithic Rathas and finally to structure
                            temples.</p>

                            <h1>The Pandya Dynasty</h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>The Pandya are the earliest mentioned of the Tamil ruling chieftains. They first appeared in
                            Greek writings in the fourth century B.C.E. and were said to have sent ambassadors to Roman
                            emperors. The Pandya rulers governed the most southern part of the Indian subcontinent and
                            initially practiced Jainism, but later became Hindus, specifically Shaivas. The main city of
                            the Pandyas was Madurai, where Tamil kings held three Sangam poetry
                            academies.
                            There, scholars produced much of the unique Tamil literature from this period. The symbol of
                            the
                            Pandya Dynasty was the fish. After ruling southern India for centuries, infighting and
                            Islamic
                            invaders weakened the dynasty, which eventually ended around the 16th century C.E. </p>
                        <p>The Pandya capital during this period was Madurai, which remains an important city in Tamil
                            Nadu today. The Construction of temples under the Pallavas was carried forward by their
                            contemporaries the Pandya’s. The architectural style of the Pandya’s is a blend of
                            Structural and Monolithic temples.

                            The rock-cut temples of the Pandya’s contain “Monolithic Vimanas”. Some of the important
                            rock cut temples are found in Anaimalai, Thirupparankundram, Karaikudi, Kalugumalai, Trichy
                            and Malayadikurichi.

                            Most of the cave temples and rock-cut temples are built under the patronage of Lord Shiva
                            and Vishnu.</p>

                                the Maldive Islands and parts of Sri Lanka during the 10th century C.E. To celebrate his
                                victories and reign, he commissioned the Brihadisvarar Temple at Tanjore, completed in

                            <p>Eventually, the Chola Dynasty was defeated by the neighboring Pandya Dynasty and the rule

                                Cholas ended in 1279. The Chola rulers, like the other Tamil groups, were mostly

                        </div>
                        <p>The Chera chieftains governed the southwestern coast of Tamilakam, reaching their height in
                            the
                            ninth century C.E. The first rulers were mentioned in Sangam literature in the first century
                            C.E. The city of Karur served as their capital. The Chera were known for their jewel and
                            spice
                            trade, and their royal emblem was the bow. The modern district of Kerala draws its name from
                            the
                            Chera Dynasty.</p>
                        <p>The Chera dynasty was one of the principal lineages in and before the Sangam period history
                            of
                            the state of Kerala and the Kongu Nadu region of Western Tamil Nadu in southern India.
                            Together
                            with the Cholas of Uraiyur (Tiruchirappalli) and the Pandyas of Madurai, the early Cheras
                            were
                            known as one of the three major powers (muventar) of ancient Tamilakam in the early
                            centuries of
                            the Common Era.</p>
                        <p>Cheras of the Kongu country are known to have controlled western Tamil Nadu with empire in
                            central Kerala in early medieval period. Present-day central Kerala probably Kongu Chera
                            kingdom
                            detached around 8th-9th century CE to form the Chera Perumal kingdom and Kongu chera
                            kingdom(c.
                            9th- 12th century CE). The exact nature of the relationships between the various branches of
                            Chera rulers is somewhat unclear.The Nambutiris asked for a regent of the Chera king from
                            Punthura and were granted the prime minister hailing from Punthura. Hence the Zamorin holds
                            the
                            title 'Punthurakkon' (King from Punthura).After this, the present Kerala parts and Kongunadu
                            became autonomous. Some of the major dynasties of medieval south India - Chalukya, Pallava,
                            Pandya, Rashtrakuta, and Chola - seems to have conquered the Kongu Chera country. Kongu
                            Cheras
                            appear to have been absorbed into the Pandya political system by 10th/11th century CE. Even
                            after the dissolution of the Perumal kingdom, royal inscriptions and temple grants,
                            especially
                            from outside Kerala proper, continued to refer the country and the people as the "Cheras or
                            Keralas".</p>
