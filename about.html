      <p>The Zine is an independent, small-scale online publication that is produced through noncommercial means and is meant to appeal to a best-fitted audience. The term zine derives from fanzine, an amalgamation of the words fan and magazine.</p>
      <p>The Zine is typically created in many DIY ways and then reproduced. Theyâ€™re full of stories, poetry, recipes, doodles, callouts, resource guides and more. The Zine also have a long history of community building, art and resistance, particularly for marginalized folks and those not often centered in traditional storytelling and journalism.</p>
      <p>Zines can touch on a variety of topics from music and art, to politics, history, humor and personal memoir. Their content may be written, drawn, photographed, collaged, or any other form of combining words and imagery. A zine's structure may be narrative, journalistic, comic-like, or completely abstract!</p>
